# MongoDB+Express.js+React.js+Node.js+GraphQL

### Rest API
* Stateless ,client independent API for data exchange.
* We always send all data back to the client from an endpoint.
* If we want some less data we'll need to create a new endpoint in backend or we'll send parameters for the data we need.
* GET/POST/PUT/... requests.

### GraphQL API
* Stateless ,client independent API for data exchange with higher query flexibility.
* No problem here regarding queries (very flexible).
* Only POST requests for every type of request to one single endpoint.
